    Introducing the Java FullStack Developer Specialization, designed to empower your software development career by providing a comprehensive skillset for building integrated, cloud-ready web applications.

The specialization consists of three intensive courses:

 1   Fundamentals of Java Programming: 

        Understanding of core Java programming concepts and principles

        Proficiency in object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction

        Gaining knowledge in advanced Java topics like multi-threading, concurrency, and the application of common data structures

2    Front-End for Java Full Stack Development: 

        Acquiring essential skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating interactive web pages

        Mastery of the Angular framework, including the development of reactive forms and handling of HTTP requests

        Building and deploying complex web applications that integrate with APIs

3    Data Structures & Back-End with Java: 

        Knowledge of fundamental data structures and algorithms and their implementation in Java

        Proficiency in server-side programming with Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP)

        Experience in connecting to databases using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and working with industry-standard frameworks like Spring and Hibernate

By the end of this specialization, you'll be well-versed in Java programming, dynamic front-end web development using Angular, and robust back-end system creation using Spring and Spring Boot.
